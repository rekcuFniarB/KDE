ImageShack Service Menu for KDE
===
It's a service menu for Dolphin (or other file manager for KDE, for example the Krusader) that allows you to upload pictures to the [imageshack.us](http://imageshack.us).
After uploading, it places link to the clipboard. Just right-click on the picture file and select `Actions` → `Upload to Imageshack.us`.

Also You can use `imageshack.us file.jpg` command from console to upload pictures.

Package also contains `screenshot` command line util, which makes a screenshot, uploads it to the [imageshack.us](http://imageshack.us) and places link to the clipboard. It's very useful with keyboard shortcuts (set them in the KDE systemsettings).
Usage: `screenshot` for taking screenshot of full screen, `screenshot -ub` for active window and `screenshot -s` for region of the screen. Also accepts other scrot args.

Ubuntu users can install **imageshackus** package from [ppa:retratserif/utils](https://launchpad.net/~retratserif/+archive/utils "Launchpad.net").
